Benefits of Express:
1) syntax simple
2) Read / Write simple
3) Updation simple
4) response and request and routing all so simpler than node
5) secure more
6) server style logic**

This works in order from top to bottom. If we do not encounter any favourable case then in the end we give a general case i.e. 404 page
