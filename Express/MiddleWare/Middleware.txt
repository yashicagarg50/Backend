This is included in express only.
This process is used between sending the requests and receiving the responses.

Types of middlewares:
1) app.use(_______) -> Global middleware function
2) app.get(_______) -> Specific path middle ware function

Benefits of middleware:
1) Error handling
2) Returning 404 pages
3) Logger function
4) For converting/to pass json into java script obj : app.use(express.json())

How to use them?
We write function which has 2 parameters(req,res) but in missleware functions we have 3 parameters 
(req,res,next){
-----process
next(); //so that next middleware function is called
}

In error handling, we have 4 parameters(req,res,next,--) using which we can handle errors easily
