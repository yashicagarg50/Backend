HTTP METHODS:
request and response cycle follows protocols called HTTP protocols

HTTP PROTOCOLS:
1) GET : to get data
2) POST : to send data
3) PATCH : to update data
4) DELETE : to delete data 

POSTMAN : To display the requests sent via HTTP. We also get to know all the requests we have send. we don't need frontend for this only the backend.

API
--------------------------------
Application Programmable Interface(API)
--------------------------------

REST API : If APIs follow rules then are called REST APIs
(Representational State Transfer)

Rules:
1) Response should be same , irrespective of request platform 

2) Routes should be named on the basis of nouns

3) HTTP methods should be used for doing operations on these routes
(app.get app.post app.patch app.delete)

4) always in JSON format

5) APIs should be stateless (after getting requests and responses then it doesnt recognises it second time if same request is sent. state is not stored. one time thing)

If REST APIs are used: 
1) 95% websites supports rest APIs
2) community support is provided
